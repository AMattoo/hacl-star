# HACL* cryptographic code extracted to C

This directory contains C code extracted from F*.  We renamed and
reorganized the generated files for clarity and for performance.  

In particular, we concatenated the Bignum and MAC-specific files for
Poly1305 into a single Poly1305.c file that exposes only the
`onetimeauth` function.  Similarly, we concatenated all the
Curve25519 files into a single file that only exposes `scalarmult`.

We also added `static` and `inline` attributes to help the C compiler
generate more efficient code.  In the future, this code restructuring
and C attributes will be directly generated by KreMLin.

## Code

+ Stream ciphers: Chacha20.c, Salsa20.c, HSalsa20.c 
+ MAC: Poly1305_64.c
+ Elliptic Curve: Curve25519.c
+ NaCl API: NaCl.c
+ Test: test-poly.c, test-salsa.c, test-curve.c, test-nacl.c

## Testing

Run `make test` to run some test cases and to measure performance relative to libsodium.

The Makefile relies on GCC-6, because of its superior support for tail-recursive code,
but any C compiler should work. The test code relies on libsodium. For like-for-like comparison, 
compile libsodium with `--disable-asm` so that the tests only use the C code in libsodium.
