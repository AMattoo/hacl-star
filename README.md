=========

HACL* is a formally verified cryptographic library in [F\*], developed
as part of [Project Everest].  HACL
stands for High-Assurance Cryptographic Library and its design is
inspired by discussions at the HACS series of workshops.       The goal of
this library is to develop *reference* implementations for popular
cryptographic primitives and to verify them for memory safety,
side-channel resistance, and (where applicable) functional
correctness. All code is written and verified in F\* and
then compiled to C or to OCaml for execution. 
The primitives and constructions supported currently are:

* Stream ciphers: Chacha20, Salsa20, XSalsa20
* MACs: Poly1305
* Elliptic Curves: Curve25519
* NaCl API: secret_box, box

HACL* can be used in two ways. The verified primitives can be directly
used in larger verification projects.  For example, HACL* code is used
as the basis for cryptograrphic proofs of the TLS record layer in
[miTLS].  Alternatively, developers can use HACL* through the [NaCl API]. 
In particular, we implement the same C API as [libsodium] for the
Box and SecretBox primitives, so any application that runs on
libsodium can be immediately ported to use the verified code in HACL*
instead.

# Warning

This library is highly experimental and a work-in-progress. Do not use
it in production systems without consulting the authors.

# Installation

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

To verify the F\* code, you need to install the [F\*] typechecker.
To extract F\* code to C, you need to install [KreMLin].

For convenience, we have already extracted C code for our verified
primitives and made them available in [snapshots/hacl-c](snapshots/hacl-c).
To run that code, you need a modern C compiler (preferably GCC-6).
To compare its performance with the C reference code in libsodium,
download and compile [libsodium] with the `--disable-asm` flag.

# Browsing and testing the code

The F\* code for our primitives is in the [code](code) directory
Note that Poly1305 and
Curve25519 share a good chunk of Bignum field arithmetic code, and
this shared code is in code/bignum.  There are Makefile targets in
each directory for verification and extraction.  
You can run `make test` in `snapshots/hacl-c` to run tests on already
extracted code.

# Performance

HACL* primitives, when compiled to C, are as fast as state-of-the-art
C implementations. You can see the numbers for your platform and C compiler
by running `make test` in extracted/c.

Of course, the raw performance is still much worse than hand-written
assembly code.  Linking HACL* to verified assembly language components
is a long-term goal.


# Experimental features

The [code/experimental](code/experimental) directory includes other (partially verified) cryptographic primitives that will become part of the library in the near future:
* Elliptic Curves: NIST P-256, Curve448
* Encryption: AES-128, AES-256
* Hash functions: SHA-256
* MACs: HMAC, GCM
* Key Derivation: HKDF

We are also working on a JavaScript backend to F* that would enable us to extract HACL* as a JavaScript library.
